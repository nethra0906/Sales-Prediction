This dataset, containing 2013 sales data for 1559 products across ten outlets in various cities, offered a rich platform to explore regression modeling. The objective was to build a predictive model to estimate the sales of these products for the following year at each of the BigMart outlets. The dataset also included detailed attributes for each product and store, providing deep insights into the factors influencing sales. Completing this project not only strengthened my understanding of regression techniques but also demonstrated how machine learning can empower businesses like BigMart to optimize their sales strategies effectively.
