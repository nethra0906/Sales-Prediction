**BigMart Sales Prediction Using Regression Modeling**

**Overview**
This project focuses on predicting sales for BigMart outlets using regression modeling techniques. The dataset contains 2013 sales data for 1559 products across ten outlets in various cities, providing a rich platform to explore and analyze factors influencing sales.

**Objectives**
**Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
**Model Building:** Develop and train regression models.
**Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the models and optimize them.

**Tools and Libraries**
**Python:** Programming language used for analysis.
**Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for model building.
**Pandas:** Data manipulation.
**Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Data visualization.

**Steps**

**1.Data Preprocessing**
**Handle Missing Values:** Impute or remove missing data.
**Remove Outliers:** Identify and eliminate outliers.
**Normalize Features:** Scale features for better model performance.
**Split Data:** Divide the data into training and testing sets.

**2.Model Building**
**Define Models:** Set up regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
**Train Models:** Train the models on the training data.
**Tune Hyperparameters:** Optimize model parameters for better accuracy.

**3.Evaluation**
**Performance Metrics:** Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to evaluate models.
**Model Comparison:** Compare the performance of different models.

**Results**
The Random Forest model generally outperformed the Decision Tree model, providing more accurate predictions of housing prices. Key insights include the importance of certain features like location, number of rooms, and property type.

**Conclusion**
This project not only strengthened my understanding of regression techniques but also demonstrated how machine learning can empower businesses like BigMart to optimize their sales strategies effectively.
